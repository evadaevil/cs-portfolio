    <h2>What is HTML and CSS?</h2>
    <p>HTML is important because it is the language that most websites are made
    with.<br>  HTML is the
    basic outline of websites. In 1980 a physicist named <br> Tim Berners-Lee
    and a contractor from CERN made a prototype of ENQUIRE</br> so they could
    share their documents; Then later developed HTML in the<br> late 1990s. 
    HTML is started with "<!DOCTYPE html>" and has multiple tags. <br>
    CSS is the design of the website (font color, background, ect.)<br>
    CSS is written to describe the presentation of the HTML code.</br>
    A tag is what you use in programming so the computer knows what you are
     </br>programming.  To write a tag add "<>" with whatever function
     you want in between the tags.<br> An attribute is a value which is between 
     the "<>" tags.  If you change the attribute, you change the<br> function of
     it.  For example you change < title > < /title > tags to < h1 > < / h1>, the 
     title <br> becomes a heading.</p> <br></br>
